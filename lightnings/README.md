# Lightning Talks

The conference with begin with lightning talks.

## Who?

Every attendee will present a lightning talk.

## What?

A [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) is a super-short talk given with the aid of one or two slides.

For this session, please prepare two slides to be presented in three minutes:

1. **Slide one:** Ninety Seconds on yourself, who you are, and your perspectives;
1. **Slide two:** Ninety seconds on an idea you have at the intersection of research software engineering and data science

Please create your slides as a PDF file with no videos or animations and submit them as a pull request to this directory. You can also email them to `robert dot haines at manchester dot ac dot uk`.

## How?

Talks will be timed by the session chair ([Rob](https://github.com/hainesr)), who will also control the slide deck. Slides will be compiled into a single deck before the session starts.

This is not because Rob is a control-freak, but because one of the nice features of these sorts of sessions is that the momentum is maintained. Also, with such short talks, switching laptops for each talk ends up taking longer than the talks themselves.

In the interests of reproducibility, the full talks deck will be compiled with:

```shell
$ pdfunite *.pdf All.pdf
```

## Why?

Lightning talks are a great way to quickly get a feel for who everyone is and what their interests are. It's a nice way of seeding coffee conversations between people who haven't met before.
